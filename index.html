        <p>
            I have spent the past 10+ years working at corporations and helping them increase 
            revenue through the use of effective marketing and advertising. I am passionate about 
            both analytics and creativity and I’ve sought to excel at both during my career. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            Combining my past experience of focusing on results-oriented marketing and key metrics, 
            I can design UX solutions that engage the user while growing your business.  I am able to 
            focus on how the overall design will focus on meeting key strategic business objectives.
        </p>
        <p>               
            Good design takes time and requires continuous improvement to be engaging and effective, 
            but great design requires deeply understanding your customer and being able to understand
            what motivates them to use your product. By building a base of loyal customers, your 
            organization will experience an increase in sales and profitability. Investing in the User 
            Experience is one of the best business decisions you can make!
